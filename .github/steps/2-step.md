## Step 2: Explore & Summarize Project Management Processes and Create README

In this step you will:

- Explore the process docs in the docs/ folder (e.g., project-lifecycle.md, roles-responsibilities.md, communication-plan.md)
- Generate a 3‚Äì4 paragraph summary in your Copilot Space (workflows, roles, communication, quality)
- Use that summary to create/attach the existing issue about the README
- Create a pull request adding a README that links all process docs and includes the brief overview

### üìñ Theory: Attaching issues and assigning to the GitHub Copilot coding agent

While reading, note:

- End-to-end workflow stages and handoffs
- Defined roles/personas and responsibilities
- Decision / escalation points
- Communication cadences and channels
- Quality gates, reviews, and acceptance criteria

You will use the prompts below to:

1. Summarize the docs
2. Attach the prior issue
3. Generate a PR adding a docs/ README with links + overview

Proceed to the activities and run the provided prompts in your Copilot Space.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Explore the project management process docs and Summarize in your Copilot Space

- Generate a summary should be 3-4 paragraphs covering the main processes OctoAcme uses for project management.
- Open your Copilot Space you created in the previous step. https://github.com/copilot/spaces or by clicking the name <img width="50%" height="50%" alt="link to Copilot Space" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a636e078-64ea-4a0f-9760-3a26a6c464a8" />
- Start a new conversation in the Copilot Space and prompt the following:

<img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Copilot Spaces new conversation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0947ede-5957-4e90-87f7-918536e6d233" />

   > ```prompt
   > Create a 3-4 paragraph summary of the project management processes used by OctoAcme based on the documentation in the docs folder of this repository.
   > Focus on key workflows, personas/roles, communication strategies, and quality assurance practices.
   > ```

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Attach an issue and create a pull request for the Copilot coding agent

- In this activity we will attach the issue you created in the previous step for adding a README
- Use the previous summary we created and create a pull request to address the issue
- This will assign the issue to the coding agent to create a pull request with the README file in the `docs/` folder
- Copy and paste the url for the issue that we created in the previous step. ex. https://github.com/octocat/skills-democratize-tribal-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In all conversations with Copilot Spaces, always be aware of the following:
> - Use the **GPT-4.1** model
> - Pull request drafts utilizes GHCP coding agent, therefore your prompt should contain `Using the github-copilot-agent tool`
> - There is a known issue for pull requests that you may get following response

<img width="50%" height="50%" alt="pull request error" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/284b3fd1-7079-4bfd-90b9-1d8245b12cbc" />

   > ```prompt
   > - Using the github-copilot-agent tool create a pull request based on the attached issue.
   > - The README should also contain a brief overview of the project management processes used by OctoAcme based on the summary we just created.
