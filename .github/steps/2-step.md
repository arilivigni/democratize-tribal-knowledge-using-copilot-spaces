## Step 2: Explain the Project Management process docs

Now that you have the repository added as a source, it's time to explore OctoAcme's project management processes. All the documentation is stored in the `docs` folder, and you need to understand what processes are currently in place.

### üìñ Theory: Process Documentation Analysis

Effective project management relies on well-documented, consistent processes. Documentation serves as the foundation for:
- Onboarding new team members
- Ensuring consistent execution across projects
- Identifying gaps and improvement opportunities
- Scaling practices across growing teams

When analyzing process documentation, look for:
- Clear step-by-step procedures
- Defined roles and responsibilities  
- Decision-making frameworks
- Communication protocols
- Quality gates and checkpoints

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Summarize Project Management Processes

1. Browse to the `docs` folder in this repository
2. Review all the project management process documents
3. Using GitHub Copilot (or manual analysis), create a comprehensive summary
4. In the comments of this issue, provide a summary that includes:
   - Overview of the current project management approach
   - Key processes documented in the `docs/` folder
   - Primary roles and responsibilities mentioned
   - Any gaps or areas that seem unclear

Your summary should be 3-4 paragraphs covering the main processes OctoAcme uses for project management.

- Look for files like `project-lifecycle.md`, `roles-responsibilities.md`, `communication-plan.md` in the docs folder
- Focus on understanding the overall workflow rather than memorizing every detail
- If using Copilot, try asking: "Summarize the project management processes in the docs folder"
