## Step 1: Create a Copilot Space

You've just been hired as a project manager at OctoAcme, a growing tech company. Your team is struggling with scattered project management knowledge - processes are documented in different places, tribal knowledge exists only in people's heads, and new team members have trouble getting up to speed. You've heard about GitHub Copilot Spaces and want to use it to centralize and democratize your team's project management knowledge.

### üìñ Theory: Understanding Copilot Spaces

GitHub Copilot Spaces is a collaborative workspace that allows you to ground Copilot's knowledge in your specific context. By creating a dedicated Space, you can:

- **Centralize knowledge**: Bring together documentation, code, and processes in one place
- **Add contextual sources**: Include repositories, documentation, and other resources that inform Copilot about your work
- **Enable focused conversations**: Use Copilot with deep understanding of your specific domain and processes
- **Scale expertise**: Make tribal knowledge accessible to everyone on your team

Spaces help transform scattered information into an organized, searchable, and intelligent knowledge base that grows with your team.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create Your Project Management Copilot Space

1. Navigate to GitHub Copilot Spaces in your GitHub account
1. Click "Create new Space" or the equivalent option
1. Name your Space: "OctoAcme Project Management Hub"
1. Add a description: "Centralizing and democratizing project management knowledge for the OctoAcme team"
1. Set the Space visibility according to your organization's policies
1. Create the Space

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have access to Copilot Spaces yet, you can simulate this step by taking notes on what you would include in your Space setup.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Add Source Repositories

1. In your newly created Copilot Space, look for "Sources" or "Add Source" section
1. Add this exercise repository as a source:
   - Repository URL: `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>`  <!-- Replace with the URL of your fork or copy of this repository -->
   - This gives Copilot access to the project management documentation and processes
1. Wait for the repository to be indexed (this may take a few minutes)
1. Verify the repository appears in your sources list
1. (Optional) If you have other project management repositories or documentation, add them as additional sources

- Make sure you have access to GitHub Copilot Spaces (currently in beta/limited access)
- The repository should be publicly accessible for Copilot to index it
- If you can't access Copilot Spaces, you can continue by manually exploring the repository structure and documentation
- Repository indexing can take 5-10 minutes depending on size
