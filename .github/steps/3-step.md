## Step 3: Add a chat mode project management process deep dive

Time to create a specialized chat mode that will help you dive deeper into OctoAcme's project management processes. Custom chat modes allow you to focus Copilot's capabilities on specific topics and workflows.

### 📖 Theory: Custom Chat Modes in Copilot Spaces

Custom chat modes are specialized conversation contexts that guide Copilot to focus on specific domains, use cases, or expertise areas. They work by:
- Providing domain-specific context and vocabulary
- Establishing conversation patterns and question types
- Focusing responses on particular aspects of your work
- Enabling more targeted and relevant assistance

For project management, a custom chat mode can help with:
- Process analysis and improvement
- Gap identification
- Best practice recommendations
- Role and responsibility clarification

### ⌨️ Activity: Create and Use Project Management Deep Dive Chat Mode

1. Create a new file at `.github/chatmodes/project-management-deepdive.md`
2. Add content that defines a chat mode focused on project management process analysis
3. Use this custom chat mode to ask the following three questions:
   - "Are there any gaps in the process?"
   - "Suggest improvements to OctoAcme's project management process"
   - "What other roles/personas should OctoAcme account for?"
4. Document the responses in the comments of this issue
5. Include insights about what the chat mode revealed about your processes

> [!TIP]
> If you can't create the actual chat mode, simulate the deep dive by manually analyzing the documentation and answering those three questions based on your review.
